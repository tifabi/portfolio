# Tiffany Fabianac Data Science Portfolio

I am fueled by a passion to help people. I want to use machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science to change the World. 

I started the Market Trend Analysis project to track clinical trials and then biotech companies. Now I'm considering the impact of identifying successful trials and companies for physicians using open FDA and CDC data.
